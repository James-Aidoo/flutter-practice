# Places Touring App

A flutter project using clean architecture to design a basic Places touring app featuring UI and Place data from the YouTube video: https://bit.ly/3HyfMv9.

This is a pathfinder project as I try to find out what project architecture and libraries (packages) I would like to use for subsequent flutter projects.

## Getting Started

### Setup

After cloning and running pub get to download the packages, run `flutter pub run build_runner build` to generate the needed files as I added all generated files to my .gitignore list.
